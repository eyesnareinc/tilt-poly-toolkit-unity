# Tilt Poly Toolkit for Unity

This is a sample Unity Project based on 2017.4.4f1 including both the [Poly Toolkit](https://github.com/googlevr/poly-toolkit-unity) and the [Tilt Brush Toolkit](https://github.com/googlevr/tilt-brush-toolkit).

This allows you to use assets from the [Google Poly website](https://poly.google.com/) and/or any artwork exported from [Tilt Brush](https://www.tiltbrush.com/).

For more information, refer to the [Poly online
documentation](https://developers.google.com/poly/develop/unity) or the [Tilt Brush online documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YID89te9oDjinCkJ9R65bLZ3PpJk1W4S1SM2Ccc6-9w/).

Note: _Poly Toolkit version: v1.1.2_ | _Tilt Brush Toolkit version: v16.0.0_

## Installing Tilt Poly Toolkit

If you are a _user_ of Poly Toolkit or the Tilt Brush toolkit (most common case), you probably do not
need to download the sample project. You can simply download a
[pre-built package](https://github.com/mwellck/tilt-poly-toolkit-unity/releases).

Note: If you are using Unity 2018 or above, you will need to enable the
_unsafe code_ option in **Player Settings** before installing the package.
This is because Poly Toolkit uses `unsafe {}` code blocks for direct
pointer manipulation when parsing files, for performance reasons.
